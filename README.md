## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project, I learn about the Spread syntax (...):

```js
export function update() {
  addSegments();

  const inputDirection = getInputDirection();
  for (let index = snakeBody.length - 2 ; index >= 0; index--){
    snakeBody[index + 1] = {...snakeBody[index] }
  }

  snakeBody[0].x += inputDirection.x;
  snakeBody[0].y += inputDirection.y;
}
```

### Continued development

Following this project, I will continue working on small JavaScript projects (calculator or 2048 game) to exercise my self and improve my JavaScript and CSS skills. I am also going to learn more about React.
